# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Carlos, a software engineer. My main interest are:
 + Blockchain, web3 development with real world applications.
 + Game development.
 + Artificial Inteligence.

I studied for 2 years at UAB (Autonomous University of Barcelona) learning all the basics of IT and then dropped out to specialize on my own.

This was due to the feeling of going too slow at my univesity's pace and due to really wanting to start working fully focused on my own project ideas.
